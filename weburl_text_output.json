Churchill used the speech to emphasize the necessity for the United States and Britain to act as the guardians of peace and stability against the menace of Soviet communism, which had lowered an iron curtain across Europe. The term iron curtain had been employed as a metaphor since the 19th century, but Churchill used it to refer specifically to the political, military, and ideological barrier created by the U.S.S.R. following World War II to prevent open contact between itself and its dependent eastern and central European allies on the one hand and the West and other noncommunist regions on the other. Context In the immediate aftermath of World War II, British and American leaders and political strategists were skeptical of the geopolitical ambitions of their recent ally the Soviet Union. As early as May 1945, when the war with Germany was hardly over, Churchillwhom the British electorate would soon replace as prime minister with Clement Attlee amid the Potsdam Conference had foreseen that most of eastern Europe would be drawn into the Soviet sphere of influence. The Soviets having indeed quickly exerted firm control over most of the countries of eastern Europe, there were two prevalent schools of thought in the West regarding how best to engage with the U.S.S.R. in the postwar world. According to the first, Soviet leader Joseph Stalin was committed to limitless expansion and would only be encouraged by concessions . According to the second, Stalin was amenable to a structure of peace but could not be expected to loosen his hold on eastern Europe so long as the United States excluded him from, for instance, Japan. U.S. President Harry S. Truman and the State Department drifted between these two poles, searching for a key to unlock the secrets of the Kremlin and hence the appropriate U.S. policy. In Churchills view, Soviet policies offered little chance for a successful establishment of peace in the years ahead. American diplomat George Kennan came to a similar conclusion and became the architect of the containment policy. He argued that the Soviets were determined to spread communism throughout the world and were fundamentally opposed to coexistence with the West. While he doubted the potential efficacy of attempting to conciliate and appease the Soviets, Kennan was convinced that they understood the logic of military force and would temper their ambitions when confronted with determined counterpressure from the West. Churchills warning In February 1946, at Trumans invitation (and with his confidential encouragement), Churchill, no longer the prime minister, traveled to Westminster College in Fulton, Missouri, where he delivered a speech in which he warned the Americans of Soviet expansion, saying that an iron curtain had descended across the European continent, from Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic: Behind that line lie all the capitals of the ancient states of Central and Eastern Europe....All these famous cities and the populations around them lie in...the Soviet sphere, and all are subject, in one form or another, not only to Soviet influence but to a very high and, in some cases, increasing measure of control from Moscow. Churchill proposed the establishment of a special hyper-entwined relationship between the United States and the British Commonwealth as a counterforce to Soviet expansionist ambition in the nascent but intensifying Cold War : Fraternal association requires not only the growing friendship and mutual understanding between our two vast but kindred systems of society but the continuance of the intimate relations between our military advisers, leading to common study of potential dangers, to similarity of weapons and manuals of instruction, and to the interchange of officers and cadets at technical colleges. At the same time, Churchill emphasized the paramount importance of increased European integration , thereby foreshadowing the cooperation that would eventually lead to the establishment of the European Union : The safety of the world, ladies and gentlemen, requires a new unity in Europe from which no nation should be permanently outcast. Westminster College commemorated the landmark speech which Churchill titled The Sinews of Peaceby bringing from London and reconstructing on its campus the church of St. Mary the Virgin, Aldermanbury. The church had been designed by Christopher Wren in the 17th century and was damaged by German bombing during World War II.

Churchills speech is considered one of the opening volleys announcing the beginning of the Cold War. Churchill's Secret Bunkers During World War II, a secret network of tunnels was built under London to keep Churchill's communications lines intact. Churchill, who had been defeated for re-election as prime minister in 1945, was invited to Westminster College in Fulton, Missouri where he gave this speech. President Harry S. Truman joined Churchill on the platform and listened intently to his speech. Churchill began by praising the United States, which he declared stood at the pinnacle of world power. It soon became clear that a primary purpose of his talk was to argue for an even closer special relationship between the United States and Great Britainthe great powers of the English-speaking worldin organizing and policing the postwar world. In particular, he warned against the expansionistic policies of the Soviet Union. In addition to the iron curtain that had descended across Eastern Europe, Churchill spoke of communist fifth columns that were operating throughout western and southern Europe. Drawing parallels with the disastrous appeasement of Hitler prior to World War II, Churchill advised that in dealing with the Soviets there was nothing which they admire so much as strength, and there is nothing for which they have less respect than for military weakness. Truman and many other U.S. officials warmly received the speech. Already they had decided that the Soviet Union was bent on expansion and only a tough stance would deter the Russians. Churchills iron curtain phrase immediately entered the official vocabulary of the Cold War. U.S. officials were less enthusiastic about Churchills call for a special relationship between the United States and Great Britain. While they viewed the British as valuable allies in the Cold War, they were also well aware that Britains power was on the wane and had no intention of being used as pawns to help support the crumbling British empire. In the Soviet Union, Russian leader Joseph Stalin denounced the speech as war mongering, and referred to Churchills comments about the English-speaking world as imperialist racism. The British, Americans, and Russiansallies against Hitler less than a year before the speechwere drawing the battle lines of the Cold War.
